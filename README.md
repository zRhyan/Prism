# Prism ðŸŒˆ

**Prism** is a personal web application (PWA) designed to help users reflect on their daily performance and track personal metrics. Inspired by the concept of a prism revealing hidden colors, this app acts as a mirror to uncover insights that often go unnoticed in our daily routines, helping users make better decisions and evolve over time.

## ðŸŒŸ Purpose

Prism aims to reveal the hidden patterns in everyday life, allowing users to understand how different aspects of their dayâ€”such as sleep, exercise, study, social interactions, and mental strategiesâ€”interact and influence their overall performance. The app encourages mindfulness and self-awareness, transforming ordinary daily habits into meaningful insights.
